# Image Search discord.js
With this bot you can search for image all over the internet and get the result in a navigation embed!

## Initialation 
First thing first you need to get an API key by creating a new google project using the Custom Search API

Then you will have to create [you own google search engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/all). For having many results, you'll have to select multiple search engines.

In the settings enable "Search all over the web" and "Image search"  

Then install the npm package request
```bash
npm install request
```

## Ending
In the end you just need to save the CX ID of your search engine, you can find it on settings and save your api token, then put both of them in the code.
